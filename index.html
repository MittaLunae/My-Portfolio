            Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Lillian Nissen. I am a 30-something year old with a career history in customer service and commerical sewing. My transition into the tech industry was an unexpected one. I have an assocciates degree in fashion design and clothing construction. Over the years, I have considered myself lucky in being able to procure jobs in my degree field. I have worked as a general steamstress, sailmaker, marine canvas fabricator, and uphlsterer. My sewing career has been a very rewarding one. But as the economic market is ever changing, I too, found myself in need of a career change. With the tech world constantly evolving, I took a leap into joining it by enrolling in a coding and web development bootcamp through Michigan State University. From my exerience in sewing and fabrication I developed a keen eye for detail and numbers which I bring to my web applications.
